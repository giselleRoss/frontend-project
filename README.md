# frontend-project 
This project uses AJAX calls, different event listeners, and an API to pull jokes from.
## Usage
User can click on an image to get a random dad joke. If they want to search for different dad jokes, they can search into a search box any word. If there are no jokes found, the dad will say no jokes found. If there are jokes with that word, it will populate the first joke in a quotebox next to the image. A show more button will pop up if there are more than 2 jokes. The user can click on the show more button and it will scroll down to the jokes
## Features
Feature 1: Click event listener on image and search button
Feature 2: Keypress event listener on search box
Feature 3: Audio play event plays when image is clicked or when a joke is searched
